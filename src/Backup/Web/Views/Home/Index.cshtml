                    REST</a> architecture and we really much care about extensibilty. We work on
                @Html.ActionLink("API", "apiV11", new { area = "", controller = "home" })
                that allows any third-party vendors to integrate. It also provides abilities to
                build new applications that uses existing functionality created for trackyt.net.
                This is a big area for improvements for mobile applications.
